# Code Formatting Rules

## Line Length Preference
- Default maximum line length: 120 characters
- Do NOT perform line wrapping unless a line exceeds 120 characters
- Only break code intentionally when it increases readability, even for lines shorter than 120 characters

## Readability Priority
- When a line is under 120 characters, keep it on one line unless breaking it significantly improves readability
- Examples of when to break shorter lines:
  - Long function calls with many parameters
  - Complex nested expressions
  - Long conditional statements
  - When breaking makes the code structure clearer

## Enforcement
- This rule applies to all code I write or modify
- Do not automatically wrap lines that are 120 characters or less
- Only wrap when explicitly needed for readability or when exceeding 120 characters

## Exceptions
- Follow language-specific conventions when they conflict with this rule
- Respect existing codebase formatting if modifying existing files
- Use common sense - if a line is 119 characters but would be much clearer broken, break it
