# Backend Extension Points

- To add a new tool:
  1. Create a new class in the appropriate subdirectory, inheriting from `Tool`.
  2. Register it in the module.
  3. Add tests in `tests/test_tools/`.
  4. Update documentation if needed.
  5. Follow CLI integration patterns in `tools_cli.py`.
- For new models, use dataclasses or Pydantic models as appropriate.
- See [structure.md](mdc:.kiro/steering/structure.md) and [system-architecture/design.md](mdc:.kiro/specs/system-architecture/design.md).

Example:
```python
class MyNewTool(Tool): ...
```
